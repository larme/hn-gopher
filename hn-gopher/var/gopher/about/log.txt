The server has been moved from an RPi 1 Model B to an RPi 3.
Double the RAM and 4x the CPU cores! This should help to
alleviate some of the slowness that I was observing,
particularly when posting new messages to the guestbook.

I have also refreshed the formatting on several pages. This
was done as part of an effort to streamline the UI experience.
Of note, the guestbook is now cleaner and no longer attempts
to include geo-location data based on the message IP address.

Since I was migrating the server, I took the opportunity to
create a backup. The /archive section is now up to 2.4 GB in
total size.
