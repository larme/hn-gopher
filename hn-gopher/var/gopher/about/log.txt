The server has been unreachable for the past three days. I installed
a new router at my house, and had to fight with Comcast for hours in
order to get access to the port forwarding settings again. I will be
monitoring for further connectivity issues.

The server has been moved from an RPi 1 Model B to an RPi 3.
Double the RAM and 4x the CPU cores! This should help to
alleviate some of the slowness that I was observing,
particularly when posting new messages to the guestbook.

I have also refreshed the formatting on several pages. This
was done as part of an effort to streamline the UI experience.
Of note, the guestbook is now cleaner and no longer attempts
to include geo-location data based on the message IP address.

Since I was migrating the server, I took the opportunity to
create a backup. The /archive section is now up to 2.4 GB in
total size.
